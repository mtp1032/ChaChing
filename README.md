ChaChing

CURRENT VERSION 1.0.0

NOTE: This version is a complete rewrite (from scratch) of its predecessor.

DESCRIPTION:
ChaChing is a yet another addOn permitting a player to sell items in bulk. To this end, ChaChing supports the following options
    (1) Sell all poor quality (i.e., grey colored) items. This is the default, 
    but the player can turn this option off
    (2) Optionally, sell all common quality (i.e., white) armor or weapons items. 
    (3) ChaChing also supports the ability to exclude any item, poor, common, uncommon, 
    rare, or epic. This is especially useful for common items such as skinning knives, 
    fishing poles, arclight spanners, etc.,
    (3) Sell all items, regardless of type or quality, by selecting a bag from which 
    ALL items within that bag will be sold. 

NOTE 1: if an item is on the excluded list and in a checked bag, the item WILL NOT BE SOLD. 
NOTE 2: The ChaChing filters DO NOT apply to items you sell manually (by right-clicking on
        an item in your bag). If you have a fishing pole configured to be excluded and you
        inadvertantly click the item in your bag, the merchant will still buy it.

USAGE:
When a player opens a merchant window, ChaChing places a button at the top left of the window,[ChaChing]. When/if this button is clicked, ChaChing will vendor all of the items in the player's inventory as configured by the player. If, for example, bag[2] was configured as a "sell
 all" bag, ChaChing will sell all items in bag[2] in addition to all other configured items. 

SETTING OPTIONS:
You may access ChaChing's interface options menu via ChaChing's minimap icon (a yellow $$ sign).

The following options are available:

(a) Two checkboxes, [Sell Gray] and [Sell White] item. The latter only sells common quality Armor and Weapons.

(b) Up to five bag icons. Clicking on the icon tells ChaChing to sell ALL items in that bag (excluded items notwithstanding).

(c) Excluding selected items: if a player wants to prevent ChaChing from ever selling an item, the player must drag the item from your inventory to the menu's edit box and double click. This will place the item in a table of items that will be excluded from sales. For example, most of us have a common (white) quality fishing pole. You should place all such needed items in this exclusion table of items not to be sold.

NOTE: Unlike the grey and white item checkboxes, bag selections are not retained between sessions, UI Reloads, and so forth.
